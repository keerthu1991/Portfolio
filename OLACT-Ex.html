    <!--p>In OLACallTaxi, Passenger is provided with two options for payment<br>
    1.Postpaid: Postpaid payment mode enforce payment of the ride taken by passenger within 7 days 
    also notifies to recharge if the passenger has 0 balance or balance less than the ride fare.<br>
2.CASH:Normal cash payment initiated by the passenger. </p>
<p>Driver Role:<br>
Initially drivers are notified with either payment is done or not , they are unaware of Postaid payment mode, this is why out of 10, 
4 passengers pay thru cash by mistake or driver's plea even if postpaid mode is on and they are been followed by the admin for re-payment 
of the fare thru postpaid mode since admin are unaware of the driver's request or update. Hence, in this module, I have come with a small alert message
to showcase, what the payment is done. Driver has 1 or 2 options to select depending on customer payment mode<br>
1.CASH(Pictorial representation is also incl):If selected this then "cash payment done" alert will get updated in passenger acc and admin 
portal provided the passenger has postpaid mode activated and cash paid unknowingly. <br>
AND
2.Postpaid(Pictorial representation is also incl):If selected this then "postpaid payment done" will get updated in passenger acc and admin 
portal provided the passenger has postpaid mode activated</p-->
